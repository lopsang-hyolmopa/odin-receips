    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Take classic Mediterranean flavors and make American-style comfort food
      for your family! If you are looking for a meatless meal, serve this with a
      salad and crusty bread. If your family prefers a protein, a rotisserie
      chicken or a slice of ham would be an easy and tasty addition to the
      lovely flavors of this casserole.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ medium onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 pound fresh asparagus, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced mushrooms</li>
      <li>2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 cups 1% milk</li>
      <li>⅔ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, divided</li>
      <li>¼ cup shredded provolone cheese</li>
      <li>⅓ cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 7x11-inch
        baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook gemelli at a
        boil until flexible but still firm to the bite, about 6 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat until
        shimmering. Add onion and stir for 2 minutes. Add asparagus and
        mushrooms and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms
        begin to soften and asparagus is bright green, about 4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add tomatoes, garlic, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Continue
        cooking for about 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the vegetable mixture into a large mixing bowl. Drain pasta and
        stir into the bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in the same skillet. Add flour and cook, stirring
        constantly, until the mixture bubbles, about 4 minutes. Pour in milk,
        stirring briskly to avoid lumps. Continue to stir until sauce thickens
        and bubbles again, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 1/3 cup
        Parmigiano-Reggiano and provolone cheese until melted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the cheese sauce over the pasta and vegetables and stir to combine.
        Pour into the prepared baking dish. Taste and adjust seasonings. Toss
        remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano with bread crumbs and sprinkle over the
        casserole.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and lightly browned, 20 to 25
        minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
